YipYap is a pass-to-play word game. After setting up the game, each player will input a single word related to the topic before passing the phone on to the next player. At the end, there is an option to save the story. Have fun creating stories with friends!

Created in Android Studio for [Keith Brigg's](https://github.com/kabriggs991) CSCI 490 Android App Development class.
